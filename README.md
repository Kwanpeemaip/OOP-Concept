# Comparison of OOP in Java, C++, and Python

## Overview
This project explores the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by implementing a comparison of three programming languages: Java, C++, and Python. It includes a series of classes and demonstrates key OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Contents
- Introduction to OOP concepts
- Implementation of an `Animal` class and its subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`
- Comparison of execution results in Java, C++, and Python

## Features
- **Class**: Demonstrates how classes are defined and utilized.
- **Object/Instance**: Shows the creation of instances from classes.
- **Subclass/Derived Class**: Illustrates the relationship between parent and child classes.
- **Message**: Provides examples of method calls.
- **Inheritance**: Highlights the use of inheritance in OOP.
- **Polymorphism**: Demonstrates polymorphic behavior through method overriding.
